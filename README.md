# Road Safety Data Analysis & Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes UK road accident data and presents actionable insights through a **Power BI dashboard**.  
The analysis aims to identify accident patterns, severity distribution, high-risk locations, and the influence of environmental factors on road safety.

The dataset underwent extensive **data cleaning, standardization, and deduplication** to ensure accurate reporting.  
The interactive dashboard allows stakeholders to explore accident trends by location, time, severity, weather, and road conditions.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** â€“ Dashboard creation, KPI tracking, and interactive visualizations  
- **Excel / CSV Processing** â€“ Data preprocessing  
- **Data Cleaning Techniques** â€“ Deduplication, label correction, normalization  

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Steps performed:
1. **Deduplication** â€“ Removed duplicate `Accident_Index` entries to ensure uniqueness.
2. **Label Standardization** â€“ Corrected misspellings (e.g., "Fetal" â†’ "Fatal").
3. **Normalization** â€“ Unified values for fields like `Junction_Control` and handled missing data (`NULL` for unknown junction types).
4. **Value Corrections** â€“ Fixed inconsistent category labels for better grouping and visualization.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- **Total Casualties:** 418K  
- **Total Accidents:** ~308K  
- **Most Affected District:** Birmingham  
- **Accident Severity:**  
  - Slight injuries: ~263K  
  - Serious injuries: ~40K  
  - Fatal injuries: ~4K  

### Environmental Conditions
- Most accidents occurred in **fine weather + high visibility** and **dry road conditions** (208K+ cases).
- Hazardous conditions (snow, floods) caused fewer accidents but had **higher fatality ratios**.

### Junction & Traffic Control
- **Auto traffic signals** involved in ~48.7% of accidents.
- ~31.8% accidents occurred away from junctions.

### Time Trends
- Peak months: **October (28.4K)** & **November (29K)**.
- Lowest month: **February (21.9K)**.
- Most accident-prone day: **Friday (51K)**; least: **Sunday (34K)**.

## ðŸ’¡ Insights & Recommendations
1. **Policy & Enforcement** â€“ High accident counts in clear weather suggest driver behavior as a key cause; stricter junction enforcement needed.
2. **Awareness Campaigns** â€“ Focus on Fridays, weekends, and festive months (Octâ€“Nov), even in good weather.
3. **Infrastructure** â€“ Review junction designs at high-accident intersections; improve signage & add pre-warning systems.
4. **Emergency Readiness** â€“ Prioritize quick response mechanisms in Birmingham.
